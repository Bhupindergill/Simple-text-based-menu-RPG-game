# Simple-text-based-menu-RPG-game

Made a basic text menu turn-based RPG game. It's fairly simple, you start at a town with a few options of shopping and stopping at an inn to restore HP.
You can then battle monsters based on your level. Each level progressed means a new monster to fight. Level ups occur once 100 exp is reached.
The shop only sells potions. Weapons and armors upgrads ended up not getting implmeneted, but I had plan according to the source code.
The magic system also never got implemented. Magic is a pickable command during battle, but does nothing.
The game ends after a few levels, since not a whole lot of enemies were implemented.

Still kinda cool. Made when I was 17 years old. 2011.
